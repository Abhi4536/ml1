        "A parameter is an internal variable of a model that is learned from the training data. For example, in linear regression, the slope and intercept are parameters.\n",
        "\n",

        "Correlation measures the relationship between two variables—how one variable changes with respect to another. It ranges from -1 to +1.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. Example: The more time you spend watching TV, the less time you may spend studying.\n",
